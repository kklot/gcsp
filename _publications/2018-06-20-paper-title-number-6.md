excerpt: ' In Vietnam, the National Cancer Control Plan was started in 2008 with aims to provide effective diagnosis and treatment. Even though the Cancer Control Network over 2011-2020 had been approved by the Ministry of Health, the cancer control infrastructure in Vietnam is still inadequate.[1] Given the limited resources, reallocation of available facilities and infrastructure to low-accessibility areas is thus of great importance.'
